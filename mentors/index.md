title: Mentors
---

<blockquote>Mentors are people from the community who volunteer to work with a student.
Mentors provide guidance such as pointers to useful documentation, code reviews, etc.
In addition to providing students with feedback and pointers, a mentor acts as an ambassador to help student contributors integrate into their project’s community.</blockquote>

Becoming a mentor can be a fun and rewarding experience.
It is also a great way to help grow the community around your particular Clojure project.
You can get started now by posting suggestions for student projects on the [project ideas page](/project-ideas/).
Additionally, you can now request an invitation to be a mentor on [#gsoc][slack-gsoc] in the [Clojurians slack][slack].

### Responsibilities

To be a successful mentor, you will need to:

* Keep in touch with your student
* Take the time to review your student’s work
* Report on your student’s progress at the mid-term and the final.
  You should be able to fail your student if he or she is not performing.

A mentor does not need to micromanage a student.

Would you like to get paid to work on Clojure over the summer?
Great!
On this page you will find the information you need to apply to Clojure as a GSoC student.


## Getting ready for GSoC

It’s still early in the process, but applying to be a GSoC student is very competitive.
Here are some things you can do now to improve your application:


### Get in touch with a mentor

One of the most important things you can do to strengthen your application is to communicate with potential mentors.
A mentor can help you by reviewing your project ideas and giving you suggestions on how to improve your application.
Additionally, when selecting students, students who already having good working relationships with mentors will be in much stronger positions.

### Get involved with the community

Talk about your idea on the [Clojure mailing list][clojure-ml] or the appropriate channels in the [Clojurians slack][slack].
These are great places to get feedback on your idea and find potential mentors.
If you will be needing to interact with one or more existing projects, get involved on those projects’ mailing lists and talk to the people involved with those projects.
All of these things will raise awareness of you and your project making it more likely that you will be able to find a good mentor.

### Research your project

A good application will show that the you have taken the time to understand the project you would like to work on over the summer.
This includes being able to point out what are the prerequisites for your project (i.e. specific skills needed to be able to complete the project) and how you meet them.
Also, you should be able to point out possible trouble spots for your project and how you plan to mitigate those risks.

### Show initiative

Good GSoC students are self-motivated, manage their work independently, and handle difficulties as they arise.

### Start working on your application

You will not be able to submit an application until the 20th of March, but you can go ahead and review the [application template](application-template.md).
